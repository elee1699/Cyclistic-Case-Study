Cyclistic Case Study:

The following project is a case study I completed using fabricated data provided through the Google Data Analytics Professional Course. 

The task assigned was to observe and analyze how two different customer types who used the fictional Cyclistic bike sharing platform differed in their use, in order to aid with an upcoming marketing campaign.
These customer types were defined as "Members", who paid a subscription fee directly to Cyclistic for certain perks not explicitly defined here, and "Casual" who used the bikes through the app as they needed with no additional subscription.

Attached in this repository are the excel files for Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 data, where some preliminary data cleaning and maniuplation was conducted to get an idea of the data.
I looked primarily at the length of rides for all customers in the data, and then added a field for the day of the week the ride occured by way of thedate and time already provided in the data.

After the preliminary portion I uploaded and combined both datasets to R for further cleaning, manipulation, and to combine the necessary fields into a single 2019 & 2020 dataset.
The combined dataset has the average ride length of each rider type (member, casual), by day of the week.

I then uploaded this combined dataset into Tableau in order to create the necessary visualizations to convey the values derived in the combined dataset. 
After this I created a mock presentation in PowerPoint, with an overview of the project, the task assigned to me, and my analysis and visualizations to support the three suggestions I gave for the marketing campaign at the end of my presentation. 

The R file, PowerPoint, and any datasets used or created in this project are located in this repository.

Thank you,
